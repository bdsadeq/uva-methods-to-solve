                - vector cross product can be used easily to check the alignment (observe

                This problem tests on bipartite testing and MST. Firstly, after reading in

                valid. If the graph is not bipartite, exit with the "Invalid data, Idiot!".

                are negative edges and the company wants to minimize loss, the program must

                This is a simulation/math problem. Firstly, all keys must be mapped to a 
                coordinate. If the x, y coordinates start from the bottom left, then for 
                example, the key z on the QWERTY keyboard will have the coordinate (1.5, 
                0.5). Using this information, the coordinates of the respective home keys 
                must then be stored in arrays. From there, for every statement read in, 
                every character of the statement must have its distance between every home 
                key calculated and the shortest distance found will be added to the total. 
                The formula used for calculating distance is the math formula for

                (y1 - y2)^2).</font></p>

                to convert this data into a number. As there are only 400 represent-able 
                values for each position (plus an additional 0 to represent courses that are
